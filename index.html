							<h3>Web Scraping</h3>
							<p>In this series of smaller projects I learned how to scrape text data , tables on wikepedia and cryptocurrency Historical data  on a login protected site using their API and rendered JScript code on the reddit HomePage to unlock more parseable links. Checkout the individual Jupyter notebooks here -->  </p>

							<h3>My first neural network Model </h3>
							<p>working on the IRIS Dataset, I learned in this university assigned project how to pre-process my dataset and use gradiant descente to minimize a loss function and improve predictions via retropropagation , I observed the decrease of my cost function(and so can you by clicking the icon next to this ) after computing accuracy

							   This app was assigned to me part of a programming project where a hypothetical training center would need to handle it's participants and organize training sessions. I took it  upon myself to learn the Jframe framework for graphical interface and while the messy graphical interface code from the all-nighter after an exam period was messy , it still got the job done and was definitely a rewarding experience for my curiosity . </p>

							<h2>Time-Series Analysis of Conversion Rates [ARMAX model] </h2>
							<p>using YahooFinance , I scraped the Australian Doller conversion rate to USD,GBP and CAD (major english speaking countries).After splitting the data between 3 Key dates , I manually fitted an ARMAX model on one pair and used auto_arima for a couple others . We predicted the shocks well  and analyzed the PCF of residuals and checked for stationarity with the ADfuller test aswell making meaningful plots along the way.

							<h3>Time-Series Analysis of XCA crypto Volatility [Garch model]</h3>
							<p>The Chia cryptocurrency promises an enviromentally friendly future for miners and cheaper GPUs for Gamers.The crypto that surpassed it's founders' expectations relies on HDD plotting instead of GPU mining .I set out to explore the volatility of the crypto born earlier this year , although my work was simplistic I admit further analysis and observation can be carried out ! </p>

							<h3>Why Julia</h3>
						</header>
						<blockquote>Julia truly is a programming language that successfully manages to combine the high performance of compiled languages with the agility of the dynamic ones...excelling at numerical computing.
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>Julia is fast :programs are compiled at runtime to efficient native code for multiple platforms. </blockquote>
